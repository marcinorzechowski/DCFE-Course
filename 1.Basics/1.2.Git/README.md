**NOTE 1**: If you want to update your fork (synchronize with my repo) then you have to first add my repo as remote (``` git add remote deftcode https://github.com/DeftCode-IT/DCFE-Course.git ```), change branch to master and then use command ``` git fetch deftcode ```.

**NOTE 2**: When creating **pull request** always remember to do it between YOUR branch and YOUR master branch. You should only create pull request to MY master branch when you want to propose some change to my repo.

**NOTE 3**: Always **create new branch** from master branch.
