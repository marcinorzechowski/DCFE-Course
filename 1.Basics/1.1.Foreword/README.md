# Foreword
## Tools
You will need three tools to work: code editor, console and web browser.

### Code editor

I'm recommending you using code editor with syntax high-lighting and auto-completion. From experience I can recommend:
- [**Webstorm**](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) - Great IDE but unfortunately not free (There is 30-days trial). Best IDE front-end developer can have in my opinion.
- [**Sublime Text**](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - Fast, light code editor. I'm using it often if I have to make some fast fix in code.
- [**Atom**](https://atom.io/) - Code editor created by Github. If you don't like two above I can also recommend this one.

### Console

Here only thing I can recommend you is [**Cmder**](http://cmder.net/) for Windows because I have zero experience with consoles on Linux or Mac.

### Web browser

Chrome or Firefox. Really no other choice. Oh, there is also Vivaldi, new player in game, really nice but it is too small to be noticeable.
I prefer Chrome because of really good Dev Tools, especially these days.

## Good practices

I want you from very beginning to write code properly, accordingly to styleguides I'm providing you. Even if you don't know HTML, CSS and JavaScript good enough to understand every good practice remember to come back to them everytime you learn something new to check if there is good practice for that.

## Git GUI
I think none of you want all the time write commands in console to work with git and repos. This is why you will fall in love with [**SourceTree**](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/), [**Github for Desktop**](https://desktop.github.com/) or build-in GUI in **Webstorm**.
